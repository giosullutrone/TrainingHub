On espère beaucoup toutefois d'un changement de décor, d'un séjour à la montagne, loin de l'agitation de la ville, et à proximité d'un sanatorium, au cas où les agressions de l'air viciaire de Paris devraient se manifester de nouveau.\n\nLes premiers jours de villégiature, entre Levallois-Perret et Saint-Denis, nous offrent un spectacle des plus interessants de la vie paysanne, vie à la campagne. Malgré la proximité de la ville, la nature se fait remarquer par son empuissant. C'est un paysage varié de petits champs encastrés dans des contre-embardements de terre, alternant avec des bois et des buttes, parfois couverts de constructions rurales. A l'horizon, sur la ligne des hauteurs, se dressent les clochers de Saint-Denis.\n\nCe fut une semaine de calme, de repos, de promenades dans la campagne. La santé de monsieur s'améliora sensiblement. On espère pouvoir l'envoyer bientôt chez un médecin du plein air, dans les Pyrénées ou dans les Alpes.\n\nJ'ai lu avec plaisir les feuillets de votre magazine. C'est bien fait, intéressant, et j'ai apprécié les illustrations. \n\nVeuillez agréer, Monsieur, l'assurance de mon profond respect, \nS. G... \nParis, le 29 octobre. ",
